# About my first project on GitHub
Face Detection: Uses deep learning models like MTCNN, Haar cascades, or SSD-based detectors to identify faces in an image.
Feature Extraction: Extracts facial features using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or pre-trained models like VGGFace, ResNet, or MobileNet.

Age Estimation: A regression-based model predicts the approximate age of the detected face.
Gender Classification: A classification model determines whether the detected face belongs to a male or female.

Applications:
Social media analytics
Security and surveillance
Customer behavior analysis
Personalized marketing
Commonly Used Frameworks:
OpenCV
TensorFlow/Keras
PyTorch
Dlib
